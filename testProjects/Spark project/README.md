# Spark Project
In this project we work on Spark datasets (US census data). We use Spark SQL to load the data and register it as a dataframe. After exploring and visualizing the data, we build machine learning pipeline to create a couple of binary classifiaction models using Spark ML (with some MLlib too). We also perform cross validation in order to find the optimal hyperparameters for the best classifer.
