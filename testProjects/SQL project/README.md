This is a project using SQL to work on databases from [Mode](https://community.modeanalytics.com/sql/tutorial/a-drop-in-user-engagement/). The data has similar structure to that of Yammer, a social network for communicating with coworkers. The aim is to find potential issues that caused a drip in user engagement. A whole report is available at: https://modeanalytics.com/alice007/reports/04897d97c68a.
